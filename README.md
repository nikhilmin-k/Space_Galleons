A neat game where you destroy enemy ships

### Controls:

##### F: full sail, accelerated to max speed
##### H: half sail, deccelerates to half speed 
##### O: steer left
##### P: steer right
##### A: fire starboard side cannon
##### D: fire port side cannon

Running this processing script will spawn you in the center of the screen with your ship facing upwards. The controls do not function correctly when pressed simultaneously.  The user's ship accelerates and deccelerates gradually between full and half sail.  

There is currently no limit to the number of ships that can be present on screen at once and one spawns in around every 9 seconds.  The program may crash if left alone for too long as a result.
